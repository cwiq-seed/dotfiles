# Seed
_Repeatable Developer Environments_

* [Documentation](https://tinyurl.com/cwid-seed-reference)

These settings must only apply to a user and their development
host. Settings for realms and repositories must be configured in those
environments directly.

**This is not intended to be run in constrained, air-gapped
environments.**

## Roots

* blackbox - open source resource
* sandbox - experiments that are regularly cleared
