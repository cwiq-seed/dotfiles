# CWIQ-Seed
_Repeatable Developer Environments_

CWIQ-Seed is the first-mover on a network. Before there are PXE servers, DHCP servers, DNS servers, there needs to be a host that initializes the _first action_.

CWIQ-Seed is an automated collection of tools that enables developers to create personalized environments quickly on hosts. It combines tools including:

* ChezMoi
* Ansible
* Direnv
* Usepackage
* BitWarden 
* Starship
  
to ensure that dotfiles and secrets are properly managed. The scope of CWIQ-Seed is limited to the developerâ€™s environment. Non-developer modifications to the host environment must be made with Ansible playbooks that are themselves managed by CWIQ-Seed.

## Setup

1. Fork this repository into your Github account under your user `$username/dotfiles`
2. Provision a bare metal or VM host (KERNEL_RUNTIME) with Alma Linux 9 or Ubuntu 24.04.
3. Create your user with sudo privileges.
4. Then run

```bash
$ curl -L tinyurl.com/cwiq-seed-init | sh
```
